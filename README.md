# Day2-Chocolate-Count
Ashi has recently developed a fondness for chocolates. The shopkeeper presents Ashi
with an interesting offer: for every three chocolates Ashi consumes, the shopkeeper will
reward her with an additional chocolate in exchange for three empty chocolate
wrappers. Ashi is now uncertain about the maximum number of chocolates she can
indulge in.
Given the total money Ashi has and the cost of one chocolate, help her figure out how
many chocolates she can eat.
